## Bloc Chat

Bloc Chat is built using the AngularJS framework. Together with FireBase NoSQL DB and AngularFire, Chat Room commits your messages to the backend and returns a promise in real time with two way data binding. This simple, yet elegant application could be a standalone tool or integrated into a larger project for communication purposes.
